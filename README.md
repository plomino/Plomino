Introduction
============

Plomino is a powerful and flexible web-based application builder for Plone.

Features
========

* create your own custom applications from a web interface without programming
* create and design forms in WYSIWYG mode
* easily embed charts or maps
* create specific actions with formulas (compute fields, send emails, ...)
* adapt the application behaviour depending on the user access rights and roles
* import/export your application structure and/or your application data,
  including replication between Plomino instances

Positioning
===========

Plomino is a **through-the-web application builder**, hence:

* it is not a **through-the-web content-type builder** like 
  `Dexterity <http://plone.org/products/dexterity>`_, which is perfect to
  create a custom content type but that will always stick to the standard
  content management scenario, while Plomino allows any custom scenario,
* it is not just a **form generator** like 
  `PloneFormGen <http://plone.org/products/ploneformgen>`_, as Plomino provides
  all the services (data storage, search, automation, import/export, etc.) to
  build an entire application. Regarding form generation itself, a major
  difference with PloneFormGen is that Plomino allows editing the form layout
  in its entirety, while PloneFormGen uses a fixed pre-defined form layout.

Resources and documentation
===========================

Screencasts and how-tos are available on http://www.plomino.net/ .

Plomino documentation is available on 
`ReadTheDocs <http://readthedocs.org/docs/plomino/>`_.

Note: if you think something is missing in the documentation, please send your
pull request at https://github.com/plomino/PlominoDoc .

Internationalization
====================

Plomino itself is internationalized and translated in seven languages.
Applications built with Plomino can be internationalized (see the 
`related documentation
<https://plomino.readthedocs.org/en/latest/features/#i18n-support>`_).

Installation
============

To deploy Plomino, you need to edit your ``buildout.cfg`` file
and add the following in the ``eggs`` section::

    eggs =
         ...
         Products.CMFPlomino

Then you have to run ``buildout`` to realize your configuration::

    bin/buildout -N

Compliancy
==========

Use version 2.x on Plone 5, and 1.x for Plone 4.

`GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/plomino/Plomino/issues>`_
