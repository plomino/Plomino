Formulas
========

Formulas are Python scripts. Example::

    return plominoDocument.getItem('price') * 15

return the value of the ``price`` item multiplied by 15.

.. Note::
    a formula does not necessarily need to return a value -- you may
    just need to make some changes in some documents (for instance if it
    is the formula in a Plomino action), so the return value would be
    irrelevant.

``plominoDocument`` is a reserved name which corresponds to the
current document on which the formula is evaluated.

``plominoContext`` is a reserved name which corresponds to the
context in which the formula is evaluated. In many cases this will be 
the same as ``plominoDocument``, but in some cases the formula is executed
on an object which is not a Plomino document (but a view, or a form, for
instance). 

Document items should be accessed using the ``getItem()`` method:
``plominoDocument.getItem('validationDate')``. 

To change an item value, use the ``setItem()`` method: 
``plominoDocument.setItem('firstname', 'Eric')``

You can access the parent Plomino database of the document (or view, or
form, according the context) using the ``getParentDatabase()`` method.

You can also access the views and the other documents. Example::

    db = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase() 
    view = db.getView('pendingPurchases') 
    total = 0 
    for doc in view.getAllDocuments(): 
        total = total + doc.getItem('price')
    return total

(this example computes the total amount for the pending purchase requests).

You can check the current user rights or roles. Example::

    db = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase() 
    user = db.getCurrentUser() 
    if db.hasUserRole(user.id, '[Expert]'): 
        return True 
    elif db.isCurrentUserAuthor(doc): 
        return True 
    elif 'PlominoEditor' in db.getCurrentUserRights(): 
        return True 
    else: 
        return False

You can change the author access rights on a given document by modifying
its ``Plomino_Authors`` item.

This item is created automatically for any document and contains the
user id of the document creator. If you want your document to be
editable by users other than its creator, it can contain other ids as
well. Example::

    authors = plominoDocument.getItem('Plomino_Authors') 
    authors.append('[Expert]') 
    if not 'inewton' in authors: 
        authors.append('inewton') 
    plominoDocument.setItem('Plomino_Authors', authors)

As you can see in this example, you can add user ids and/or user roles.

For a better understanding of the methods available on Plomino objects,
see below in this document.

Actions
=======

By default, Plomino offers few standard actions (**Exit**, **Save**,
**Delete**, **Edit**, etc.) depending on the object type (document,
view, form), on the current mode (read mode or edit mode), and on the
user access rights.

To improve the application usability, you may need to add more actions
in the forms or in the views.

To create an action, select ``Plomino: action`` in the **Add item**
Plone menu.

.. image:: images/6cee3f7f.png

Enter an identifier and a title.

Then select the action type:

- Open form: open the form indicated by the ``Parameter or code``
  parameter to create a new document.

- Open view: open the view indicated by the ``Parameter or code``
  parameter.

- Close: go back to the database home page.

- Save: submit the form with its current content, and save (or create)
  the document.

- Python script: run the formula entered in ``Parameter or code``, and
  redirect to the current object (in read mode). Examples: send a mail
  notification to someone, compute a field value and update the document
  with this new value, etc. If the formula returns a string, Plomino will 
  will assume it is a URL and use it for redirection.

- Redirect: same as ``Python script``, but the formula should return an
  URL that will be used for redirection. Example: create a new document
  using some values from the current document, and automatically open
  this new document.

You can add a *hide-when* formula to control when the action should be
visible or not.

If you select ``Display action in action bar``, the action will be
displayed together with the standard Plomino actions in the action bar.

** New in Plomino 1.5 **

Actions can be inserted directly in the form layout using TinyMCE.

Example:

.. image:: images/m2899c882.png

But (in forms only) you can also choose to insert the action within the
form layout directly. You must use the *Plomino action* style in Kupu,
and the action will be rendered according the Action display parameter
(link, submit button, or button).

Example:

.. image:: images/5eabcd6.png

Result:

.. image:: images/67218c9.png


Fields
======

Computed fields
---------------

In a form, the fields where the user can enter data are in *edit* mode.

You might also need to use fields which can not be changed by the user.
Here are the other modes offered in Plomino:

Computed
    the field value is computed with a formula each time the document is
    opened, and it is saved each time the document is saved.

Computed on creation
    the field value is computed only once, the first time the document
    is saved.

Computed for display
    the field value is computed each time the document is opened, but it
    is not saved.

Example: create a computed for display field with this formula::

    category = plominoDocument.getItem('bookCategory') 
    if category: 
        index = plominoDocument.getParentDatabase().getIndex() 
        autres = index.dbsearch({'bookCategory': category}) 
        result = "There are %s other books in the same category" % len(autres)-1
        return result
    return "" 

and insert it in the ``frmBook`` form: 

.. image:: images/m434a6b5d.png 


Validation
----------

By default, Plomino validates fields according to their type (for
instance, letters are not allowed in a Number field).

You can also add more validation criteria in the field's **Validation**
tab:

- a field can be mandatory: if the field is empty when the document is
  saved, Plomino does not save the document and displays an alert to the
  user.

- you can enter a formula to implement a specific validation rule (which
  may depend on other fields values).

For instance, in a *Purchase request* application, the maximum
authorised amount is 1000 euros. You would enter the following formula
in the TotalAmount field::

    if plominoDocument.TotalAmount>1000: 
        return 'The total amount must be under 1000 euros` 
    else: 
        return '`

Note: the formula must return an empty string if validation succeeds or
an error message if it is not.

Doclinks
--------

A Doclink field allows a Plomino document to reference another document.

The doclink stores the path to the targeted document, and it is
displayed as a link.

You may use a *view* as the source of possible targeted documents.

Example
```````

We have a Contact form allowing users to enter contact information about
company employees.

The view ``allcontacts`` returns all the contact documents:

.. image:: images/m55c9e282.png

We add a doclink field, named ``manager``, in the Contact form to enter
the corresponding manager of each employee.

.. image:: images/5ef4a230.png

It uses the ``allcontacts`` view as its document list source, and
displays the ``name`` column value as label:

.. image:: images/m4fdd0770.png

In read mode, the field displays a link to the corresponding document:

.. image:: images/m52601ab7.png

If you choose the ``Embedded view`` widget, the field displays the view
itself (including all columns), with a checkbox to select documents:

.. image:: images/m2eb3ebc9.png

Instead of using a view, you can compute the document list using a
formula (which will override the Embedded view widget), so you can
filter the documents you want to list, you can retrieve documents from
another database, or even list Plone objects which are not Plomino
documents. For example::

    contactsdb=plominoDocument.restrictedTraverse("/Plone/demo/contacts") 
    view=contactsdb.getView('allcontacts') 
    return [d.lastname+"|"+d.getPath() for d in view.getAllDocuments()] 

.. Note::
    in this example, we use the `getAllDocuments` method to get the
    documents list, this method returns Catalog brains

    To improve performance, the ``lastname`` field has been added to the
    index, so there is no need to wake up the objects (using
    `getObject`), and we use the `getPath` method to get the path of the
    real object.
    
.. Todo: 
    Hmm, getAllDocuments doesn't sound like it will return brains, it
    sounds like it will return documents. Looking at the source code, I
    see that it does in fact return documents (``d.getObject() for d in
    res``) so this must have changed since 1.3. 

Field templates
---------------

You can create a custom template to render a field in a different way
than the regular field widgets.

The field template must be added in the Resources folder in the ZMI (go
to **Design tab/Others/Resources folder**) as a Page Template.

To be applied, the template id must be then entered in the *Field read
template* or in the *Field edit template*.

The template code can be copied from the Plomino products sources
(`CMFPlomino/skins/cmfplomino_templates/**FieldEdit.pt` or
`**FieldRead.pt`).

Here is an example showing a multi-categorized tag field:

Edit template::

    <span tal:define="
        field options/field;
        db options/field/getParentDatabase;
        categories python:
            [doc.getObject() for doc in db.getView('tags').getAllDocuments()]
        ">
    <table><tr>
    <tal:loop repeat="cat categories">
        <td valign="top" tal:define="
            c cat/tagCategory;
            tags cat/tagList
            ">
        <span tal:content="c">category</span>
        <select tal:attributes="name options/fieldname"
            multiple="true"
            lines="4">
        <tal:block repeat="v python:
            [t+'|'+c+':'+t for t in tags.split(',')]
            ">
            <tal:block define="
                current options/fieldvalue;
                l python:v.split('|')
                ">
                <option tal:attributes="
                    value python:l[1];
                    selected python:test(current and l[1] in current,1,0)
                    "
                    tal:content="python:l[0]">value</option>
            </tal:block>
        </tal:block>
        </select>
        </td>
    </tal:loop>
    </tr>
    </table>
    </span>

Result:

.. image:: images/46da1d8b.png

Read template::

    <tal:block tal:repeat="v options/selection">
        <tal:block define="
            current options/fieldvalue;
            l python:v.split('|')
            ">
            <tal:block condition="
                python:test(current and l[1] in current,1,0)">
                <tal:block define="
                    v python:l[0];
                    cat python:v.split(':')[0];
                    t python:v.split(':')[1]
                    ">
            <br/><span class="discreet" tal:content="cat">category</span>
            <span class="callout" tal:content="t">category</span>
                </tal:block>
            </tal:block>
        </tal:block>
    </tal:block>

Result:

.. image:: images/2c92d666.png

Filling fields from the REQUEST
-------------------------------

Editable fields which are not part of the layout take their value
from the REQUEST.

So, for example, if you want to pass a parameter to another form:
- in the origin document, put the parameter(s) in the link to the target
  form, e.g. by adding ``?param1=value&param2=value`` to the URL. This will
  cause the parameter to be part of the ``GET`` request which retrieves the
  target form. 
- in the target form, create an editable field with the same id as the
  parameter key (e.g. ``param1`` and ``param2`` above), but do not insert it
  in the form layout. The field will get its value from the ``REQUEST``.  -
  then you can create ``Computed on save`` (or on display, or whatever)
  fields which use the value of this field.


Forms
=====

Layout
------

Accordions and lazy loading
```````````````````````````

In Plomino it is possible to *accordion* some parts of the page.  This means
that the content of the accordioned part will not be visible unless you click
on the headline to open the accordion. 

It is also possible to avoid loading the content of the accordion until such 
time as the accordion is opened. This is particularly useful if the content 
it very big, or if there are many accordions on a page and the reader is
interested in only a few of them.
 
To turn part of a page into an accordion, use this structure (the header level
can be from ``h2`` to ``h6``)::

    <h5 class="???"><a href="#">Header</a></h5>
    <div>Content</div>

.. todo:: Make that an HTML block 

.. todo:: What's possibilities for class?

If the class is ``plomino-accordion-header`` and the ``href`` is not ``#``, the 
content of the referenced page will be substituted for the following div. 

.. Note:: Plomino does not currently offer UI support for this functionality. 
   To use it, you have to generated the desired content via Python, or enter
   it literally into the form layout. 

Events
------

In a Plomino form, you can use the following events:

``onOpenDocument``
    executed before document is opened (in both read mode and edit mode)

    If the formula for this event returns a false value, opening is
    allowed; but if it returns a true value, e.g. a string,
    opening fails, and the value is displayed as an error
    message.

``onSaveDocument``
    executed before document is saved

``onDeleteDocument``
    executed before document is deleted

``onCreateDocument``
    executed before the document is saved for the first time
    (``onSaveDocument`` will also be executed, but after
    ``onCreateDocument``)

``beforeCreateDocument``
    executed before a blank form is opened.
    
In the **Events** tab, you can enter the formulas for each event you
need.

Example: enter the following formula for the ``onSaveDocument`` event::

    date=DateToString(DateTime()) 
    db=plominoDocument.getParentDatabase() 
    user=userFullname(db, db.getCurrentUser()) 
    plominoDocument.setItem(
        'history',
        plominoDocument.getItem('history') +
        "This document has been modified by "+user+" on "+date)

it will update the ``history`` item which logs all the modifications,
authors and dates.

Hide-when formulas
------------------

In a form, it might be useful to hide or display some sections according
different criteria (an item value, the current date, the current user's
access rights, etc.).

To do so, you must use Hide-when formulas.

Select ``Plomino: hide when`` in the **Add item** Plone menu.

Enter an identifier, a title, and a formula. Example:
``plominoDocument.bookState=='Damaged```

Then, modify the form layout to insert the hide-when formula in the form
layout. Enter the following: ``start:hide-when-identifier``
at the beginning of the area to hide. And the following at the end:
``end:hide-when-identifier``
And apply the Plomino *Hide-when* formula style to those 2 bounds:

.. image:: images/m33cfb2d3.png

If the hide-when formula returns `True`, the enclosed area will be
hidden. If it returns `False`, the area is displayed (in our example: if
the book is damaged, it cannot be borrowed, so we hide the action to
check the book availability).

** New in Plomino 1.5 **

Hide-when formulas can be inserted directly in the form layout using TinyMCE.

Sub-forms
---------

An application can contain several forms.

In the Book library example, we could add a CD form and a Video form.
Those 2 forms would probably have several similar fields (availability,
last borrower, return date, etc.).

To avoid having to build (and maintain) the same things several times,
you can use sub-forms.

The sub-form principle is to insert a form within another form.

In our example, we create a ``borrowInfo`` form containing the
borrower name, the return date, and the availability, and we insert it
as a sub-form in ``frmBook``, ``frmCD`` and ``frmVideo``.

The form is inserted using the Plomino *Subform* style in Kupu:

.. image:: images/m12bfc6b1.png

.. Note:: 
    as you probably do not want 'borrowInfo' to be displayed in the
    database home page, you have to check ``Hide in menu`` in the form
    **Parameters** tab.

** New in Plomino 1.5 **

Sub-forms can be inserted directly in the form layout using TinyMCE.

Search formula
--------------

When you create a search form, Plomino uses the form fields to do a
default ZCatalog search among the documents of the view associated with 
the search page.

If needed, you can create a specific search formula in the form
**Parameters** tab.

This formula is used to filter the result set of the default query, and 
must return ``True`` or ``False`` for each document in the result set.

You can access the values submitted by the search form on the ``REQUEST``
object: ``plominoContext.REQUEST.get('myfield')``.

Example::

    period = plominoContext.REQUEST.get('period') 
    if period == 'Ancien regime': 
        return plominoDocument.year 
    if period == 'Empire': 
        return plominoDocument.year >= 1804 and plominoDocument.year

.. Note::
    Search formulas can be a lot slower than regular ZCatalog searches,
    you must use them carefully.

Search event
------------

If you do not want the default filters of a search page (the view, the 
query, and the formula), you can define an ``onSearch`` event on the form
**Events** tab. The formula of this event should return the required list 
of documents. 

You can access the values submitted by the search form on the ``REQUEST``
object: ``plominoContext.REQUEST.get('myfield')``.

Page
----

Like a *Search* form, a *Page* form cannot be used to save documents;
moreover *Page* forms do not display any action bar.

Nevertheless, like any form, it can contain computed fields, actions
(inserted in the form layout), and hide-when formulas, so it is a good
way to build navigation pages, custom menus, or information pages (like
reports, etc.).

Example:

.. image:: images/m8490705.png

Here we create a page with 3 actions to access 3 different views, but
the last one is enclosed in a Hide-when formula so it will not be
displayed if the current user does not satisfy a given criteria. In the
example, we test if the user has the ``[dbadmin]`` role::

    "[dbadmin]" not in plominoContext.getCurrentUserRoles()

Result if you are not ``[dbadmin]``:

.. image:: images/78acdcb8.png

Result if you are ``[dbadmin]``:

.. image:: images/5203c813.png

Open with form
--------------

The form used to render a document is determined by a number of mechanisms:

- By default, Plomino document is displayed using the form corresponding to
  its ``Form`` item value (which contains the id of the form last used to
  save the document).

- If the view from where the document is opened defines a ``Form`` formula,
  the resulting form will be used instead.

- And to force the usage of a given form, the form id can be passed in the
  request using the ``openwithform`` parameter.

Example:

http://localhost:8080/test/testdb/58862f161ea71732944d37e0a0489cfc?openwithform=frmtest

Views
=====

Form formula
------------

You may need to read or edit documents with different forms.

For instance, a person who wants to borrow a book wants different
information (book description, category, publication year, etc.) than
the librarian (who may want last borrower, return date, availability,
etc.).

As explained previously, we can manage this issue using hide-when
formulas, actions and sub-forms.

But if the functional differences are too great, or if the layout is
totally different, those strategies will probably produce too much
complexity.

In such a case, it is better to create a totally different form (named
``frmBorrowManagement`` for instance).

Unfortunately, the document always opens with the form used the last
time it has been saved.

To open the document with a different form, you need to create a
specific view for borrow management and use the Form formula parameter.

This formula will compute the name of the form to use when the documents
are opened from the view.

If you enter ``frmBorrowManagement`` in Form formula, all the documents
opened from this view will be displayed using the ``frmBorrowManagement``
form.

View template
-------------

If you need a specific layout for a view, you can create a ZPT page
which can be used instead the default template.

This way, you can build calendar view, Gantt view, produce charts, etc.

To do so, add your Page Template in the resources folder, and enter its
name in View Template in the view Parameters tab.

A good approach is to copy the ZPT code from
``CMFPlomino/skins/CMFPlomino/OpenView.pt`` (in the Plomino sources) and
append your modifications.

.. Note:: good knowledge of ZPT is required.

Export CSV
----------

All the views can be exported as CSV. The export contains the value of
each column.

Go to the database **Design** tab, expand the **Views** section and
click the green arrow icon next to the view you want to export.

You can build views specifically for export purposes, you just need to
create the columns according the values you want to get in CSV (note: if
you do not want this view to be offered on the database home page, check
``Hide in menu`` in the view **Parameters** tab).

Database
========

Refresh a database
------------------

After copy/paste of views or forms, or deletion of fields, a Plomino
database may be corrupted.

If so, you have to refresh the database. This will re-build the database
index entirely, and destroy all the previously compiled Plomino formula
scripts (the first time a formula is called, it is compiled in a Python
Script object in the ZODB).

To do so, go to the database **Design** tab, expand the **Others**
section and click on **Database refresh**.

Refresh also migrates your database to your current Plomino version (if
Plomino has been upgraded since the database was created).

Design import/export
--------------------

You can export or import Plomino database design elements from one Zope
instance to another.

This may be useful if you want to deploy a new application from a
development server to a production server, or if you want to release a
modification or a correction on an application already in production.

To import design elements, go to the database **Design** tab, and in the
**Import/Export Design** section, fill in the following parameters:

- the URL of the Plomino database which contains the elements you want
  to import in the current database;

- user id and password corresponding to a user account on the remote
  instance. This account must be PlominoManager on the remote Plomino
  database.

Then click on refresh: Plomino will load the list of all the available
elements in the remote database.

.. image:: images/790674a2.png

You can then choose the elements you want and click on **Import** to
import them into the local database.

In some cases (depending on firewalls, proxies, etc.), it is easier to
export from the local database to the remote one.

The principle is the same, you just need to use the **Export** section.


Replication
-----------

You can replicate documents between 2 Plomino databases, possibly on 2
different Zope servers. 

.. image:: images/45edb683.png

There are 3 replication modes:
- push mode: local modifications are replicated on the remote database;
- pull mode: remote modifications are replicated on the local database;
- push-pull mode: both.

If a document has been modified in both the local and remote databases
since the last replication, there are 3 conflict resolution modes:
- local wins,
- remote wins,
- last modified wins.

Replication can be useful to synchronize information between 2 servers,
or for mobile workers who want to be able to work on a local replica.

Documents XML import/export
---------------------------

In the Replication tab (at the bottom), you can import/export documents
from/to an XML file.

.. image:: images/import-export-docs.jpg

Exported documents can be restricted to a view (meanning that only documents
selected in this view will be exported).

Document ids are preserved so if a document already exists in the target
database, it is updated and not duplicated.

Note: when importing from XML, onSaveDocument event is not called (as document
items are all part of the export).

Documents CSV import
--------------------

In the Replication tab, you can import documents from a CSV file.

.. image:: images/import-csv.jpg

You need to indicate which form has to be used to create the documents.

The first row in the CSV file must contain the field id for the considered
column.

Note: when importing from CSV, onSaveDocument event is called (as some
items might needed to be computed) but index is not refreshed to avoid
bad performances.

Start page
----------

By default, the database default screen is the generic database menu:

.. image:: images/m26047b00.png

But you might prefer to display something else instead (for instance a
view, a page, a search form, etc.).

In this case, go to your database **Edit** tab, and enter the element id
in the **Start page** parameter.

Agents
======

It might be useful to launch the same processing from different places
in the application (views action, forms action). To avoid duplicate=ing
the code, you can implement the code in an *agent*.

Select ``Plomino: agent`` in the **Add item** Plone menu, and enter an
identifier, a title and the code.

This might be useful to run archiving, cleaning, etc. without giving
manager rights to regular users.

The agent can be executed (from an action) using the ``runAgent()`` method::

    db=plominoDocument.getParentDatabase() 
    db.MyAgent.runAgent()

Note: this method can take ``REQUEST`` as parameter, which allows
variables in the querystring to be read and redirection to be performed.

If you install `ZpCron <http://old.zope.org/Members/janik/ZpCron>`_
on your Zope instance, an agent can also be scheduled. You specify when the
agent should run using a cron-like format.

With ZpCron_, you can provide the id of a user that will be used to run the
agent (so the access rights of that user are applied when the agent is
executed, not those of the current user).

Resources
=========

A Plomino database contains a ``resources`` folder in the ZODB which can
contain useful extra assets:

- images or icons you may need to insert in your forms;

- CSS or javascript files;

- ZPT templates (see view template below);

- Python files, to provide a code library usable from the different
  formulas (using the `callScriptMethod` method);

- CSV (or other) files containing useful data;

- etc.

To access this folder, go to the **Design** tab, expand the **Others**
section and click on **Resources Folder**. It opens the standard ZMI
screen, which allows new elements to be added.

Plomino Element Portlet
=======================

A portlet displaying a Plomino form can be added anywhere in a Plone site. It
can be useful to show informations, like statistics or charts (thanks to Google
Visualization, for example), computed when the page is displayed.

.. Note::

	In Plone, when you add a portlet to a page, all of its children pages
	will contain it too. For example, if you add a portlet to the main page of
	the site, it will be displayed in every pages of the site. You can prevent
	this mechanism in a child page: click on **Manage Portlets** in this page,
	find the selector next to the name of the portlet (e.g. *Plomino element
	portlet*), and select ``Block``.


You can add a portlet on a page within fiew steps:

- Click on the link **Manage portlets**
- In the **Add portlet...** selector, choose the **Plomino element portlet**
  option

A new page appears, with some fields:

- The header field sets the title of the portlet.

- Database path is the path of a Plomino database in the site, storing the
  form to be displayed. If the base is accessible at the URL
  ``http://example.org/Plone/database``, the path is ``/Plone/database``. Since
  there is always an exception to a rule, you have to be careful when the site
  URLs are re-written (e.g. if the Plone site is behind an Apache server). The
  path must be the *Plone site* path, not the public URL.

- Element ID is the form identifier (set at its creation) in the database
  specified previously.

The portlet new is now displayed in the page side.
