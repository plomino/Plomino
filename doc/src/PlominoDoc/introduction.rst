Introduction

The main objective of Plomino is to provide the ability to build
business-specific applications in Plone without requiring development of
Plone extension products.

Plomino allows you to create forms, to use those forms to view or edit
structured contents, to filter and list those contents, to perform
search requests, to add business-specific features and to automate
complex processing -- all entirely through the Plone web interface.

.. Note:: 
    Plomino is widely inspired by the IBM Lotus Domino (tm) commercial
    product, it reproduces its main concepts and features, and it uses
    its terminology (which sometimes overlaps with the Plone
    terminology).
