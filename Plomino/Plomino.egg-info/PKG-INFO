        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.5.6
        -----
        
        * Access control fix : Owner is author of any document (just like PlominoManager role)
        
        * MissingValue() method in PlominoUtils : it returns Missing.Value which can be useful
        when processing ZCatalog brains (=search results) as Missing.Value cannot be imported
        into formulas.
        
        * Do not compute column values in index if the document does not belong to the view.
        Note: it does not really change the performances when indexing, but it does reduce
        the index size.
        It also reduce the amount of error traceback in debug mode.
